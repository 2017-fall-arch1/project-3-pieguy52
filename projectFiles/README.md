This directory holds the pong implementation of project 3. This program utilizes the given assests as well some created for the project. All the added changes reside within shapemotion.c. Buttons 1 and 3 move the paddle, while buttons 2 and 4 tentatively change the velocity. The buttons are very sensative so a very light tap changes direction. Holding the button makes the paddle move in place and see what direction the paddle will move after release. Score can be kept up to 99 before the counter goes out of bounds and pointer garbage shows up on the score.
